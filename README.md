# 42_libft

This is the first project for 42 students. The goal is to programm various useful functions, students need for later, more complicated projects.

Examples are:
* ft_split  -   splits a string by a delimiter
* ft_trim   -   trims a string by defined whitespaces
* ft_atoi   -   converts a string to an integer
<br/>

In the bonus part of the project students learn how to implement linked list and functions to interact with them, e.g.:
* ft_lstadd_back/ft_lstadd_front  -  how to add elements at the begin/end of a list
* ft_lstclear                     -  how to clear the list
* ft_lstiter                      -  how to iterate over the list
