# 42_libft

This is the first project for 42 students. The goal is to program various useful functions, students need for later more complicated projects.

Examples are:
* ft_split  -   splits a string using a delimiter
* ft_trim   -   removes defined whitespaces from a string
* ft_atoi   -   converts a string to an integer
<br/>

In the bonus part of the project students learn how to implement linked lists and functions to interact with them, e.g.:
* ft_lstadd_back/ft_lstadd_front  -  how to add elements at the beginning/end of a list
* ft_lstclear                     -  how to empty the list
* ft_lstiter                      -  how to execute a function on every list element
